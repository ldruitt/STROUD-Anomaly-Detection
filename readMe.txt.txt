I got the signals from directories on my device, in order for the code to run the directories in the first lines of code must describe the 
locations of the directories so numpy con load the text files. I also removed all the empty files from the directories in A B C D and M.

I updated my code and output after submitting to miner2 but it was too late for me to resubmit my new output. My implementation is better now 
than the submission I gave to miner2.

It may be best to use the virtual environment provided in my submission in order to ensure that all the packages necessary are included!

stroud.py contains the code that runs with my created test set, used for testing k values and validation, and test.py contains the code that 
runs with TestTW and creates an output file of p-values.

I'm sorry if this causes any inconvenience but this was the best way I could think to do this!

Thank you!
